All actions that affect a comment will fire the "comment_changed" signal, which will include one of the following "actions" as a parameter:
post
edit
pre_delete # Note: The comment has NOT been deleted yet when this is fired (it is the next function call).

NOTE: post and edit will also include "version_saved" which will contain the version that was just saved (this will be None for pre_delete).


Functions that can be defined on parent object (func_name : default):
view_comments : user.is_authenticated()
post_comment : user.is_authenticated()
max_comment_depth : 2

Template tags:
{% render_comments parent_object %}

Javascript:
$('document.body').comments({% initialize_comments %});

TODO:
Create a mixin for bioshare to put on any model that will utilize comments (to set default values)
